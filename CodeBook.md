* X_test.txt - contains the test set 
* Y_test.txt - contains the test data labels for activity
* subject_train.txt - contains the identifiers for each subject that performed the activity tracked by the X and Y training files
* X_train.txt - contains the trainging set 
* Y_train.txt - contains the training data labels for activity
* activity_labels.txt - links the unique identifiers in the Y_test and Y_train data with the activity name
* features.txt - links all the measurements in the X_test and X_train data files with descriptive names
